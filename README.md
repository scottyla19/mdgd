# mdgd text editor

mdgd is a markdown text editor built in the Godot game engine that offers a basic text editor and a markdown preview pane.

The markdown parser offers previews for all the symbols available in the [Markdown Reference](https://commonmark.org/help). 

mdgd is motivated by [Emi's Making Programs with Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk0YQGb08IA&list=PLQsiR7DILTczMLsN8qmMym7pYfJXynzK0&index=1)
